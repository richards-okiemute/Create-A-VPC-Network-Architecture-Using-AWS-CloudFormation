Deploying a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for RichardsCorp Using AWS CloudFormation
The networking architecture is the most important fundamental. The network architecture determines how the applications hosted in the cloud communicates with the internet and various cloud services. 
In this project, we will leverage the power of AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service, AWS CloudFormation to deploy a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture for RichardsCorp. This project demonstrates how to automate the creation of essential network components, including VPC, subnets, route tables, and an Internet Gateway.
